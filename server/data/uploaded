C. To block the client from receiving the result
D. To handle network messages
E. To leave the blocked state; B
The server stub makes the receive system call and is in a blocked state until it receives a message back from the client, so option B is correct.
What happens when the message (result) reaches machine A in Remote Procedure Calls (RPC)?
A. The message is discarded

C. The client stub remains in a blocked state
D. The message is sent back to the client
E. The client stub receives the result and forwards it to the calling process; E
Once the message (result) reaches machine A, the operating system forwards it to the client stub, which can then leave its blocked state and forwards the result to the calling process, making option E correct.
